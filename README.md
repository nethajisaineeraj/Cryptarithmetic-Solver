# 🔐 Cryptarithmetic Solver

A Python-based solver for **cryptarithmetic addition puzzles** (e.g., SEND + MORE = MONEY) using **backtracking** and **constraint satisfaction techniques**. The program efficiently maps letters to digits to find valid solutions.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python 3.x

---

## ✨ Features
- Algorithmic approach for solving complex cryptarithmetic puzzles.
- **Backtracking & pruning** to optimize computation and reduce time.
- **Voice-based commands** to keep users engaged during longer computations.
- Clean, modular Python code for readability and reusability.

---

## 📌 Problem Example
```
  SEND
+ MORE
------
 MONEY
```
The program finds a valid mapping of letters to digits that satisfies the addition.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cryptarithmetic-solver.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd cryptarithmetic-solver
```

3. Install dependencies (if any, e.g., for voice commands):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the program:
```bash
python cryptarithmetic.py
```

## 🎤 Voice Commands
- Users can interact via voice to input puzzles or receive status updates while the program calculates solutions.
- Enhances usability and keeps users engaged during time-consuming computations.

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened **algorithm design** and **problem-solving** skills.
- Gained hands-on experience with **backtracking** and **constraint satisfaction techniques**.
- Learned to integrate **voice-based user interaction** into Python applications.
