# 🔐 Cryptarithmetic Solver

A **Python program** that solves **cryptarithmetic addition puzzles** (e.g., SEND + MORE = MONEY) using **backtracking** and **constraint satisfaction**. It maps letters to digits efficiently while keeping the user engaged with **voice-based prompts** during longer computations.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python 3.x  
- pyttsx3 (for voice interaction)  

---

## ✨ Features
- **Automated Puzzle Solver:** Finds valid digit-to-letter mappings for cryptarithmetic problems.  
- **Optimized Backtracking:** Skips invalid paths to improve performance.  
- **Voice Interaction:** Provides real-time feedback and instructions to users, enhancing experience during complex computations.  
- **User-Friendly:** Modular and readable Python code for easy extension or adaptation.
